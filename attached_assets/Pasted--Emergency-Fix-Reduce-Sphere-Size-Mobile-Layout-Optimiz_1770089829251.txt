# Emergency Fix: Reduce Sphere Size & Mobile Layout Optimization

## Issue Description
Based on the latest visual check (Image 5), the 3D spheres have become **excessively large**, causing severe overlapping. They are currently obscuring the "HUMAN PULSE" title and overlapping with each other on mobile devices.

We need to **drastically reduce the scale** and **spread out the positions** to ensure a clean, readable UI.

## Implementation Instructions

Please modify `Scene.jsx` and `EMOTION_CONFIG` with the specific values below.

### 1. Drastic Scale Reduction (Fix Oversizing)
The current scale values are too high. Please update the scaling logic to use these **smaller base values**:

* **Mobile Screens (`isMobile = true`):**
    * Standard Spheres (Joy, Anger, Calm, Sadness): **`scale = 0.5`** (Previously ~0.8)
    * Gray Sphere (Fear): **`scale = 0.65`** (Larger than standard, but much smaller than now)
* **Desktop Screens (`isMobile = false`):**
    * Standard Spheres: **`scale = 0.75`**
    * Gray Sphere: **`scale = 0.95`**

### 2. Update Mobile Coordinates (Vertical Spreading)
To prevent overlap on portrait screens, we need to spread the spheres vertically and horizontally away from the center text. Update `EMOTION_CONFIG` for **Mobile Layout**:

* **Joy (Yellow - Top):** Move higher.
    * Coordinate: **`[0, 3.2, 0]`**
* **Anger (Red - Mid Right):** Move wider and lower.
    * Coordinate: **`[1.4, 1.0, 0]`**
* **Calm (Green - Mid Left):** Move wider and lower.
    * Coordinate: **`[-1.4, 1.0, 0]`**
* **Sadness (Blue - Low Right):** Move further down and wide.
    * Coordinate: **`[0.9, -1.8, 0]`**
* **Fear (Gray - Low Left):** Move further down and wide.
    * Coordinate: **`[-0.9, -1.8, 0]`**

### 3. Camera Adjustment (Mobile)
Since the spheres are now spread out vertically, pull the camera back to keep them in the viewport.

* **Mobile Camera Position:** Change Z-axis from `10` to **`13`**.
    * `camera={{ position: [0, 0, isMobile ? 13 : 8], ... }}`

## Expected Outcome
1.  **No Overlap:** Spheres must NOT touch each other on mobile.
2.  **Text Visibility:** The center area where "HUMAN PULSE" is located must be clear of any spheres.
3.  **Visual Balance:** The Gray sphere should still be slightly larger (`0.65`) than others (`0.5`), but not overwhelming.
