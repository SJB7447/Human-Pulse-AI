# Visual & Interaction Update: Mobile Layout, Scaling, and Navigation

## Objective
We need to finalize the 3D scene with three critical updates: fixing the mobile layout, emphasizing the Gray sphere, and improving the click navigation logic.

Please implement the following changes in `Scene.jsx` and `EMOTION_CONFIG`.

## 1. Interaction Logic: "Click to Focus, Click Again to Enter"
Currently, the click interaction might be ambiguous. Let's make it strict.

* **Interaction Flow:**
    1.  **First Click:** The camera zooms in, and the sphere becomes "Active" (Focus Mode).
    2.  **Second Click (on the same sphere):** If the user clicks the *already active* sphere, immediately navigate to the route (e.g., `/emotion/joy`).
    3.  **Clicking Background:** Resets to "Idle Mode" (Zoom out).

* **Code Logic:**
    ```javascript
    const handleSphereClick = (emotion) => {
      if (activeEmotion === emotion.name) {
        // Already active? -> Navigate
        navigate(emotion.path);
      } else {
        // Not active? -> Set Active (Zoom In Animation)
        setActiveEmotion(emotion.name);
      }
    };
    ```

## 2. Mobile Responsiveness (Vertical Layout)
The current pentagon layout overlaps on portrait screens. Implement a responsive check (e.g., `window.innerWidth < 768px`).

### Coordinate Configuration
Update `EMOTION_CONFIG` to support `positionDesktop` and `positionMobile`.

* **Desktop (Pentagon):** Keep existing positions.
* **Mobile (Vertical Zig-Zag):**
    * Joy (Top): `[0, 2.5, 0]`
    * Anger (Mid-Right): `[1.0, 1.0, 0]`
    * Calm (Mid-Left): `[-1.0, 1.0, 0]`
    * Sadness (Low-Right): `[0.6, -0.8, 0]`
    * Fear (Low-Left): `[-0.6, -0.8, 0]`

### Camera Adjustment
* **Desktop Z:** `8`
* **Mobile Z:** `10` or `11` (Zoom out to fit the taller vertical stack).

## 3. Visual Hierarchy: Larger Gray Sphere
The **Gray Sphere (Fear/Neutral)** must be visually emphasized (larger/heavier).

### Scaling Logic (Conditional Scale)
Apply a scaling multiplier based on the emotion type.

* **Desktop Scales:**
    * Standard Spheres: `scale = 1.0`
    * **Gray Sphere (Fear):** `scale = 1.3` (Visibly larger)

* **Mobile Scales (Reduced overall):**
    * Standard Spheres: `scale = 0.7`
    * **Gray Sphere (Fear):** `scale = 0.9` (Still larger than others, but fits screen)

## 4. Implementation Request
Please refactor `Scene.jsx` to:
1.  Dynamic Position/Scale: Calculate values based on `isMobile` and `emotion.name` (for the Gray sphere).
2.  Updated Click Handler: Implement the "Select vs Navigate" logic described in Section 1.
